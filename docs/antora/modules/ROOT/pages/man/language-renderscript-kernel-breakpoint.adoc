Syntax: renderscript kernel

The following subcommands are supported:

      all -- Automatically sets a breakpoint on all renderscript kernels that are or will be loaded.
             Disabling option means breakpoints will no longer be set on any kernels loaded in the future, but does not remove currently set breakpoints.
      set -- Sets a breakpoint on a renderscript kernel.
