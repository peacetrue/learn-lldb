= process-handle

----
Manage LLDB handling of OS signals for the current target process.  Defaults to showing current policy.

Syntax: process handle <cmd-options> [<unix-signal> [<unix-signal> [...]]]

Command Options Usage:
  process handle [-t] [-n <boolean>] [-p <boolean>] [-s <boolean>] [<unix-signal> [<unix-signal> [...]]]
  process handle [-cd] [<unix-signal> [<unix-signal> [...]]]

       -c ( --clear )
            Removes the signals listed from the Target signal handlers

       -d ( --dummy )
            Also clear the values in the dummy target so they won't be inherited by new targets.

       -n <boolean> ( --notify <boolean> )
            Whether or not the debugger should notify the user if the signal is received.

       -p <boolean> ( --pass <boolean> )
            Whether or not the signal should be passed to the process.

       -s <boolean> ( --stop <boolean> )
            Whether or not the process should be stopped if the signal is received.

       -t ( --target )
            Show only the signals with behaviors modified in this target

If no signals are specified but one or more actions are, and there is a live process, update them all.  If no action is specified, list the current
values.
If you specify actions with no target (e.g. in an init file) or in a target with no process the values will get copied into subsequent targets, but lldb
won't be able to spell-check the options since it can't know which signal set will later be in force.
You can see the signal modifications held by the targetby passing the -t option.
You can also clear the target modification for a signalby passing the -c option
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.
