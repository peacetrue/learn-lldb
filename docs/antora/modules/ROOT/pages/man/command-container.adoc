----
Commands for adding container commands to lldb.  Container commands are containers for other commands.  You canadd nested container commands by
specifying a command path, but but you can't add commands into the built-in command hierarchy.

Syntax: command container <subcommand> [<subcommand-options>]

The following subcommands are supported:

      add    -- Add a container command to lldb.  Adding to built-in container commands is not allowed.
      delete -- Delete a container command previously added to lldb.

For more help on any particular subcommand, type 'help <command> <subcommand>'.
