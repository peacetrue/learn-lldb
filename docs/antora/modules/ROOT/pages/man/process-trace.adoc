Commands for tracing the current process.

Syntax: process trace <subcommand> [<subcommand objects>]

The following subcommands are supported:

      save  -- Save the trace of the current process in the specified directory. The directory will be created if needed. This will also create a file
               <directory>/trace.json with the main properties of the trace session, along with others files which contain the actual trace data. The
               trace.json file can be used later as input for the "trace load" command to load the trace in LLDB
      start -- Start tracing this process with the corresponding trace plug-in.
      stop  -- Stop tracing this process. This does not affect traces started with the "thread trace start" command.

For more help on any particular subcommand, type 'help <command> <subcommand>'.
