= breakpoint-modify

----
Modify the options on a breakpoint or set of breakpoints in the executable.  If no breakpoint is specified, acts on the last created breakpoint.  With
the exception of -e, -d and -i, passing an empty argument clears the modification.

Syntax: breakpoint modify <cmd-options> [<breakpt-id | breakpt-id-list>]

Command Options Usage:
  breakpoint modify [-Dde] [-G <boolean>] [-c <expr>] [-i <count>] [-o <boolean>] [-q <queue-name>] [-t <thread-id>] [-x <thread-index>] [-T <thread-name>] [<breakpt-id | breakpt-id-list>]

       -D ( --dummy-breakpoints )
            Act on Dummy breakpoints - i.e. breakpoints set before a file is provided, which prime new targets.

       -G <boolean> ( --auto-continue <boolean> )
            The breakpoint will auto-continue after running its commands.

       -T <thread-name> ( --thread-name <thread-name> )
            The breakpoint stops only for the thread whose thread name matches this argument.

       -c <expr> ( --condition <expr> )
            The breakpoint stops only if this condition expression evaluates to true.

       -d ( --disable )
            Disable the breakpoint.

       -e ( --enable )
            Enable the breakpoint.

       -i <count> ( --ignore-count <count> )
            Set the number of times this breakpoint is skipped before stopping.

       -o <boolean> ( --one-shot <boolean> )
            The breakpoint is deleted the first time it stop causes a stop.

       -q <queue-name> ( --queue-name <queue-name> )
            The breakpoint stops only for threads in the queue whose name is given by this argument.

       -t <thread-id> ( --thread-id <thread-id> )
            The breakpoint stops only for the thread whose TID matches this argument.  The token 'current' resolves to the current thread's ID.

       -x <thread-index> ( --thread-index <thread-index> )
            The breakpoint stops only for the thread whose index matches this argument.
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.
