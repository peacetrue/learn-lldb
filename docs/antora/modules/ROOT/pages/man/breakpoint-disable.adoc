= breakpoint-disable

----
Disable the specified breakpoint(s) without deleting them.  If none are specified, disable all breakpoints.

Syntax: breakpoint disable [<breakpt-id | breakpt-id-list>]
Disable the specified breakpoint(s) without deleting them.  If none are specified, disable all breakpoints.

Note: disabling a breakpoint will cause none of its locations to be hit regardless of whether individual locations are enabled or disabled.  After the
sequence:

    (lldb) break disable 1
    (lldb) break enable 1.1

execution will NOT stop at location 1.1.  To achieve that, type:

    (lldb) break disable 1.*
    (lldb) break enable 1.1

The first command disables all locations for breakpoint 1, the second re-enables the first location.
