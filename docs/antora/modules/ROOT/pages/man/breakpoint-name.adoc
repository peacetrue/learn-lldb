Commands to manage breakpoint names

Syntax: breakpoint name

Breakpoint names provide a general tagging mechanism for breakpoints.  Each 
breakpoint name can be added to any number of breakpoints, and each breakpoint 
can have any number of breakpoint names attached to it. For instance:

    (lldb) break name add -N MyName 1-10

adds the name MyName to breakpoints 1-10, and:

    (lldb) break set -n myFunc -N Name1 -N Name2

adds two names to the breakpoint set at myFunc.

They have a number of interrelated uses:

1) They provide a stable way to refer to a breakpoint (e.g. in another 
breakpoint's action). Using the breakpoint ID for this purpose is fragile, since
it depends on the order of breakpoint creation.  Giving a name to the breakpoint
you want to act on, and then referring to it by name, is more robust:

    (lldb) break set -n myFunc -N BKPT1
    (lldb) break set -n myOtherFunc -C "break disable BKPT1"

2) This is actually just a specific use of a more general feature of breakpoint
names.  The <breakpt-id-list> argument type used to specify one or more 
breakpoints in most of the commands that deal with breakpoints also accepts 
breakpoint names.  That allows you to refer to one breakpoint in a stable 
manner, but also makes them a convenient grouping mechanism, allowing you to 
easily act on a group of breakpoints by using their name, for instance disabling
them all in one action:

    (lldb) break set -n myFunc -N Group1
    (lldb) break set -n myOtherFunc -N Group1
    (lldb) break disable Group1
    
3) But breakpoint names are also entities in their own right, and can be 
configured with all the modifiable attributes of a breakpoint.  Then when you 
add a breakpoint name to a breakpoint, the breakpoint will be configured to 
match the state of the breakpoint name.  The link between the name and the 
breakpoints sharing it remains live, so if you change the configuration on the 
name, it will also change the configurations on the breakpoints:

    (lldb) break name configure -i 10 IgnoreSome
    (lldb) break set -n myFunc -N IgnoreSome
    (lldb) break list IgnoreSome
    2: name = 'myFunc', locations = 0 (pending) Options: ignore: 10 enabled 
      Names:
        IgnoreSome
    (lldb) break name configure -i 5 IgnoreSome
    (lldb) break list IgnoreSome
    2: name = 'myFunc', locations = 0 (pending) Options: ignore: 5 enabled 
      Names:
        IgnoreSome

Options that are not configured on a breakpoint name don't affect the value of 
those options on the breakpoints they are added to.  So for instance, if Name1
has the -i option configured and Name2 the -c option, adding both names to a 
breakpoint will set the -i option from Name1 and the -c option from Name2, and
the other options will be unaltered.

If you add multiple names to a breakpoint which have configured values for
the same option, the last name added's value wins.

The "liveness" of these settings is one way, from name to breakpoint.  
If you use "break modify" to change an option that is also configured on a name 
which that breakpoint has, the "break modify" command will override the setting 
for that breakpoint, but won't change the value configured in the name or on the
other breakpoints sharing that name.

4) Breakpoint names are also a convenient way to copy option sets from one 
breakpoint to another.  Using the -B option to "breakpoint name configure" makes
a name configured with all the options of the original breakpoint.  Then 
adding that name to another breakpoint copies over all the values from the 
original breakpoint to the new one.

5) You can also use breakpoint names to hide breakpoints from the breakpoint
operations that act on all breakpoints: "break delete", "break disable" and 
"break list".  You do that by specifying a "false" value for the 
--allow-{list,delete,disable} options to "breakpoint name configure" and then 
adding that name to a breakpoint.

This won't keep the breakpoint from being deleted or disabled if you refer to it 
specifically by ID. The point of the feature is to make sure users don't 
inadvertently delete or disable useful breakpoints (e.g. ones an IDE is using
for its own purposes) as part of a "delete all" or "disable all" operation.  The
list hiding is because it's confusing for people to see breakpoints they 
didn't set.


The following subcommands are supported:

      add       -- Add a name to the breakpoints provided.
      configure -- Configure the options for the breakpoint name provided.  If you provide a breakpoint id, the options will be copied from the
                   breakpoint, otherwise only the options specified will be set on the name.
      delete    -- Delete a name from the breakpoints provided.
      list      -- List either the names for a breakpoint or info about a given name.  With no arguments, lists all names

For more help on any particular subcommand, type 'help <command> <subcommand>'.
