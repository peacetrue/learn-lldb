= command-alias

----
Define a custom command in terms of an existing command.  Expects 'raw' input (see 'help raw-input'.)

Syntax: command alias <cmd-options> -- <alias-name> <cmd-name> [<options-for-aliased-command>]

Command Options Usage:
  command alias [-h <help-text>] [-H <help-text>] -- <alias-name> <cmd-name> [<options-for-aliased-command>]
  command alias <alias-name> <cmd-name> [<options-for-aliased-command>]

       -H <help-text> ( --long-help <help-text> )
            Long help text for this command

       -h <help-text> ( --help <help-text> )
            Help text for this command
'alias' allows the user to create a short-cut or abbreviation for long commands, multi-word commands, and commands that take particular options.  Below
are some simple examples of how one might use the 'alias' command:

(lldb) command alias sc script

    Creates the abbreviation 'sc' for the 'script' command.

(lldb) command alias bp breakpoint

    Creates the abbreviation 'bp' for the 'breakpoint' command.  Since breakpoint commands are two-word commands, the user would still need to enter the
    second word after 'bp', e.g. 'bp enable' or 'bp delete'.

(lldb) command alias bpl breakpoint list

    Creates the abbreviation 'bpl' for the two-word command 'breakpoint list'.

An alias can include some options for the command, with the values either filled in at the time the alias is created, or specified as positional
arguments, to be filled in when the alias is invoked.  The following example shows how to create aliases with options:

(lldb) command alias bfl breakpoint set -f %1 -l %2

    Creates the abbreviation 'bfl' (for break-file-line), with the -f and -l options already part of the alias.  So if the user wants to set a
    breakpoint by file and line without explicitly having to use the -f and -l options, the user can now use 'bfl' instead.  The '%1' and '%2' are
    positional placeholders for the actual arguments that will be passed when the alias command is used.  The number in the placeholder refers to the
    position/order the actual value occupies when the alias is used.  All the occurrences of '%1' in the alias will be replaced with the first argument,
    all the occurrences of '%2' in the alias will be replaced with the second argument, and so on.  This also allows actual arguments to be used
    multiple times within an alias (see 'process launch' example below).

Note: the positional arguments must substitute as whole words in the resultant command, so you can't at present do something like this to append the
file extension ".cpp":

(lldb) command alias bcppfl breakpoint set -f %1.cpp -l %2

For more complex aliasing, use the "command regex" command instead.  In the 'bfl' case above, the actual file value will be filled in with the first
argument following 'bfl' and the actual line number value will be filled in with the second argument.  The user would use this alias as follows:

(lldb) command alias bfl breakpoint set -f %1 -l %2
(lldb) bfl my-file.c 137

This would be the same as if the user had entered 'breakpoint set -f my-file.c -l 137'.

Another example:

(lldb) command alias pltty process launch -s -o %1 -e %1
(lldb) pltty /dev/tty0

    Interpreted as 'process launch -s -o /dev/tty0 -e /dev/tty0'

If the user always wanted to pass the same value to a particular option, the alias could be defined with that value directly in the alias as a constant,
rather than using a positional placeholder:

(lldb) command alias bl3 breakpoint set -f %1 -l 3

    Always sets a breakpoint on line 3 of whatever file is indicated.
     
     Important Note: Because this command takes 'raw' input, if you use any command options you must use ' -- ' between the end of the command options
     and the beginning of the raw input.
