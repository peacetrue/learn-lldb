= reproducer

----
Commands for manipulating reproducers. Reproducers make it possible to capture full debug sessions with all its dependencies. The resulting reproducer
is used to replay the debug session while debugging the debugger.
Because reproducers need the whole the debug session from beginning to end, you need to launch the debugger in capture or replay mode, commonly though
the command line driver.
Reproducers are unrelated record-replay debugging, as you cannot interact with the debugger during replay.

Syntax: reproducer <subcommand> [<subcommand-options>]

The following subcommands are supported:

      dump     -- Dump the information contained in a reproducer. If no reproducer is specified during replay, it dumps the content of the current
                  reproducer.
      generate -- Generate reproducer on disk. When the debugger is in capture mode, this command will output the reproducer to a directory on disk and
                  quit. In replay mode this command in a no-op.
      status   -- Show the current reproducer status. In capture mode the debugger is collecting all the information it needs to create a reproducer. 
                  In replay mode the reproducer is replaying a reproducer. When the reproducers are off, no data is collected and no reproducer can be
                  generated.
      xcrash   -- Intentionally force  the debugger to crash in order to trigger and test reproducer generation.

For more help on any particular subcommand, type 'help <command> <subcommand>'.
