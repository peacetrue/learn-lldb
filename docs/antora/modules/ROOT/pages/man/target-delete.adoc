= target-delete

----
Delete one or more targets by target index.

Syntax: target delete <cmd-options> [<target-id> [<target-id> [...]]]

Command Options Usage:
  target delete [-ac] [<target-id> [<target-id> [...]]]

       -a ( --all )
            Delete all targets.

       -c ( --clean )
            Perform extra cleanup to minimize memory consumption after deleting the target.  By default, LLDB will keep in memory any modules previously
            loaded by the target as well as all of its debug info.  Specifying --clean will unload all of these shared modules and cause them to be
            reparsed again the next time the target is run
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.
