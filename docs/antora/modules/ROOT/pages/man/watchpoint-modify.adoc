= watchpoint-modify

----
Modify the options on a watchpoint or set of watchpoints in the executable.  If no watchpoint is specified, act on the last created watchpoint.  Passing
an empty argument clears the modification.

Syntax: watchpoint modify <cmd-options> [<watchpt-id | watchpt-id-list>]

Command Options Usage:
  watchpoint modify [-c <expr>] [<watchpt-id | watchpt-id-list>]

       -c <expr> ( --condition <expr> )
            The watchpoint stops only if this condition expression evaluates to true.
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.
