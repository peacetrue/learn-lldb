= watchpoint-command-add

----
Add a set of LLDB commands to a watchpoint, to be executed whenever the watchpoint is hit.  The commands added to the watchpoint replace any commands
previously added to it.

Syntax: watchpoint command add <cmd-options> <watchpt-id>

Command Options Usage:
  watchpoint command add [-o <one-line-command>] [-s <none>] [-e <boolean>] <watchpt-id>
  watchpoint command add [-F <python-function>] [-s <none>] [-e <boolean>] <watchpt-id>

       -F <python-function> ( --python-function <python-function> )
            Give the name of a Python function to run as command for this watchpoint. Be sure to give a module name if appropriate.

       -e <boolean> ( --stop-on-error <boolean> )
            Specify whether watchpoint command execution should terminate on error.

       -o <one-line-command> ( --one-liner <one-line-command> )
            Specify a one-line watchpoint command inline. Be sure to surround it with quotes.

       -s <none> ( --script-type <none> )
            Specify the language for the commands - if none is specified, the lldb command interpreter will be used.
            Values: command | python | lua | default-script

General information about entering watchpoint commands
------------------------------------------------------

This command will prompt for commands to be executed when the specified watchpoint is hit.  Each command is typed on its own line following the '> '
prompt until 'DONE' is entered.

Syntactic errors may not be detected when initially entered, and many malformed commands can silently fail when executed.  If your watchpoint commands
do not appear to be executing, double-check the command syntax.

Note: You may enter any debugger command exactly as you would at the debugger prompt.  There is no limit to the number of commands supplied, but do NOT
enter more than one command per line.

Special information about PYTHON watchpoint commands
----------------------------------------------------

You may enter either one or more lines of Python, including function definitions or calls to functions that will have been imported by the time the code
executes.  Single line watchpoint commands will be interpreted 'as is' when the watchpoint is hit.  Multiple lines of Python will be wrapped in a
generated function, and a call to the function will be attached to the watchpoint.

This auto-generated function is passed in three arguments:

    frame:  an lldb.SBFrame object for the frame which hit the watchpoint.

    wp:     the watchpoint that was hit.

When specifying a python function with the --python-function option, you need to supply the function name prepended by the module name:

    --python-function myutils.watchpoint_callback

The function itself must have the following prototype:

def watchpoint_callback(frame, wp):
  # Your code goes here

The arguments are the same as the arguments passed to generated functions as described above.  Note that the global variable 'lldb.frame' will NOT be
updated when this function is called, so be sure to use the 'frame' argument. The 'frame' argument can get you to the thread via frame.GetThread(), the
thread can get you to the process via thread.GetProcess(), and the process can get you back to the target via process.GetTarget().

Important Note: As Python code gets collected into functions, access to global variables requires explicit scoping using the 'global' keyword.  Be sure
to use correct Python syntax, including indentation, when entering Python watchpoint commands.

Example Python one-line watchpoint command:

(lldb) watchpoint command add -s python 1
Enter your Python command(s). Type 'DONE' to end.
> print "Hit this watchpoint!"
> DONE

As a convenience, this also works for a short Python one-liner:

(lldb) watchpoint command add -s python 1 -o 'import time; print time.asctime()'
(lldb) run
Launching '.../a.out'  (x86_64)
(lldb) Fri Sep 10 12:17:45 2010
Process 21778 Stopped
* thread #1: tid = 0x2e03, 0x0000000100000de8 a.out`c + 7 at main.c:39, stop reason = watchpoint 1.1, queue = com.apple.main-thread
  36
  37   	int c(int val)
  38   	{
  39 ->	    return val + 3;
  40   	}
  41
  42   	int main (int argc, char const *argv[])

Example multiple line Python watchpoint command, using function definition:

(lldb) watchpoint command add -s python 1
Enter your Python command(s). Type 'DONE' to end.
> def watchpoint_output (wp_no):
>     out_string = "Hit watchpoint number " + repr (wp_no)
>     print out_string
>     return True
> watchpoint_output (1)
> DONE

Example multiple line Python watchpoint command, using 'loose' Python:

(lldb) watchpoint command add -s p 1
Enter your Python command(s). Type 'DONE' to end.
> global wp_count
> wp_count = wp_count + 1
> print "Hit this watchpoint " + repr(wp_count) + " times!"
> DONE

In this case, since there is a reference to a global variable, 'wp_count', you will also need to make sure 'wp_count' exists and is initialized:

(lldb) script
>>> wp_count = 0
>>> quit()

Final Note: A warning that no watchpoint command was generated when there are no syntax errors may indicate that a function was declared but never
called.
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.
