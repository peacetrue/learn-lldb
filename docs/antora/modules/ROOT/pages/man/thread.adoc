= thread

----
Commands for operating on one or more threads in the current process.

Syntax: thread <subcommand> [<subcommand-options>]

The following subcommands are supported:

      backtrace      -- Show thread call stacks.  Defaults to the current thread, thread indexes can be specified as arguments.
                        Use the thread-index "all" to see all threads.
                        Use the thread-index "unique" to see threads grouped by unique call stacks.
                        Use 'settings set frame-format' to customize the printing of frames in the backtrace and 'settings set thread-format' to
                        customize the thread header.
      continue       -- Continue execution of the current target process.  One or more threads may be specified, by default all threads continue.
      exception      -- Display the current exception object for a thread. Defaults to the current thread.
      info           -- Show an extended summary of one or more threads.  Defaults to the current thread.
      jump           -- Sets the program counter to a new address.
      list           -- Show a summary of each thread in the current target process.  Use 'settings set thread-format' to customize the individual
                        thread listings.
      plan           -- Commands for managing thread plans that control execution.
      return         -- Prematurely return from a stack frame, short-circuiting execution of newer frames and optionally yielding a specified value. 
                        Defaults to the exiting the current stack frame.  Expects 'raw' input (see 'help raw-input'.)
      select         -- Change the currently selected thread.
      siginfo        -- Display the current siginfo object for a thread. Defaults to the current thread.
      step-in        -- Source level single step, stepping into calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
      step-inst      -- Instruction level single step, stepping into calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
      step-inst-over -- Instruction level single step, stepping over calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
      step-out       -- Finish executing the current stack frame and stop after returning.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
      step-over      -- Source level single step, stepping over calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.
      step-scripted  -- Step as instructed by the script class passed in the -C option.  You can also specify a dictionary of key (-k) and value (-v)
                        pairs that will be used to populate an SBStructuredData Dictionary, which will be passed to the constructor of the class
                        implementing the scripted step.  See the Python Reference for more details.
      trace          -- Commands for operating on traces of the threads in the current process.
      until          -- Continue until a line number or address is reached by the current or specified thread.  Stops when returning from the current
                        function as a safety measure.  The target line number(s) are given as arguments, and if more than one is provided, stepping will
                        stop when the first one is hit.
