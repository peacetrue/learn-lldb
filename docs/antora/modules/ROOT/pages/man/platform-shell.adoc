= platform-shell

----
Run a shell command on the current platform.  Expects 'raw' input (see 'help raw-input'.)

Syntax: platform shell <shell-command>

Command Options Usage:
  platform shell [-h] [-s <path>] [-t <value>] -- [<none> [<none> [...]]]
  platform shell [<none> [<none> [...]]]

       -h ( --host )
            Run the commands on the host shell when enabled.

       -s <path> ( --shell <path> )
            Shell interpreter path. This is the binary used to run the command.

       -t <value> ( --timeout <value> )
            Seconds to wait for the remote host to finish running the command.
     
     Important Note: Because this command takes 'raw' input, if you use any command options you must use ' -- ' between the end of the command options
     and the beginning of the raw input.
