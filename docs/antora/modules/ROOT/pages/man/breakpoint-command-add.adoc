= breakpoint-command-add

----
Add LLDB commands to a breakpoint, to be executed whenever the breakpoint is hit.  The commands added to the breakpoint replace any commands previously
added to it.  If no breakpoint is specified, adds the commands to the last created breakpoint.

Syntax: breakpoint command add <cmd-options> [<breakpt-id>]

Command Options Usage:
  breakpoint command add [-D] [-o <one-line-command>] [-s <none>] [-e <boolean>] [<breakpt-id>]
  breakpoint command add [-D] -F <python-function> [-s <none>] [-e <boolean>] [-k <none>] [-v <none>] [<breakpt-id>]

       -D ( --dummy-breakpoints )
            Sets Dummy breakpoints - i.e. breakpoints set before a file is provided, which prime new targets.

       -F <python-function> ( --python-function <python-function> )
            The name of the function that will manage a breakpoint command.

       -e <boolean> ( --stop-on-error <boolean> )
            Specify whether breakpoint command execution should terminate on error.

       -k <none> ( --structured-data-key <none> )
            The key for a key/value pair passed to the implementation of a breakpoint command.  Pairs can be specified more than once.

       -o <one-line-command> ( --one-liner <one-line-command> )
            Specify a one-line breakpoint command inline. Be sure to surround it with quotes.

       -s <none> ( --script-type <none> )
            Specify the language for the commands - if none is specified, the lldb command interpreter will be used.
            Values: command | python | lua | default-script

       -v <none> ( --structured-data-value <none> )
            The value for the previous key in the pair passed to the implementation of a breakpoint command.  Pairs can be specified more than once.

General information about entering breakpoint commands
------------------------------------------------------

This command will prompt for commands to be executed when the specified breakpoint is hit.  Each command is typed on its own line following the '> '
prompt until 'DONE' is entered.

Syntactic errors may not be detected when initially entered, and many malformed commands can silently fail when executed.  If your breakpoint commands
do not appear to be executing, double-check the command syntax.

Note: You may enter any debugger command exactly as you would at the debugger prompt.  There is no limit to the number of commands supplied, but do NOT
enter more than one command per line.

Special information about PYTHON breakpoint commands
----------------------------------------------------

You may enter either one or more lines of Python, including function definitions or calls to functions that will have been imported by the time the code
executes.  Single line breakpoint commands will be interpreted 'as is' when the breakpoint is hit.  Multiple lines of Python will be wrapped in a
generated function, and a call to the function will be attached to the breakpoint.

This auto-generated function is passed in three arguments:

    frame:  an lldb.SBFrame object for the frame which hit breakpoint.

    bp_loc: an lldb.SBBreakpointLocation object that represents the breakpoint location that was hit.

    dict:   the python session dictionary hit.

When specifying a python function with the --python-function option, you need to supply the function name prepended by the module name:

    --python-function myutils.breakpoint_callback

The function itself must have either of the following prototypes:

def breakpoint_callback(frame, bp_loc, internal_dict):
  # Your code goes here

or:

def breakpoint_callback(frame, bp_loc, extra_args, internal_dict):
  # Your code goes here

The arguments are the same as the arguments passed to generated functions as described above.  In the second form, any -k and -v pairs provided to the
command will be packaged into a SBDictionary in an SBStructuredData and passed as the extra_args parameter. 

Note that the global variable 'lldb.frame' will NOT be updated when this function is called, so be sure to use the 'frame' argument. The 'frame'
argument can get you to the thread via frame.GetThread(), the thread can get you to the process via thread.GetProcess(), and the process can get you
back to the target via process.GetTarget().

Important Note: As Python code gets collected into functions, access to global variables requires explicit scoping using the 'global' keyword.  Be sure
to use correct Python syntax, including indentation, when entering Python breakpoint commands.

Example Python one-line breakpoint command:

(lldb) breakpoint command add -s python 1
Enter your Python command(s). Type 'DONE' to end.
def function (frame, bp_loc, internal_dict):
    """frame: the lldb.SBFrame for the location at which you stopped
       bp_loc: an lldb.SBBreakpointLocation for the breakpoint location information
       internal_dict: an LLDB support object not to be used"""
    print("Hit this breakpoint!")
    DONE

As a convenience, this also works for a short Python one-liner:

(lldb) breakpoint command add -s python 1 -o 'import time; print(time.asctime())'
(lldb) run
Launching '.../a.out'  (x86_64)
(lldb) Fri Sep 10 12:17:45 2010
Process 21778 Stopped
* thread #1: tid = 0x2e03, 0x0000000100000de8 a.out`c + 7 at main.c:39, stop reason = breakpoint 1.1, queue = com.apple.main-thread
  36
  37   	int c(int val)
  38   	{
  39 ->	    return val + 3;
  40   	}
  41
  42   	int main (int argc, char const *argv[])

Example multiple line Python breakpoint command:

(lldb) breakpoint command add -s p 1
Enter your Python command(s). Type 'DONE' to end.
def function (frame, bp_loc, internal_dict):
    """frame: the lldb.SBFrame for the location at which you stopped
       bp_loc: an lldb.SBBreakpointLocation for the breakpoint location information
       internal_dict: an LLDB support object not to be used"""
    global bp_count
    bp_count = bp_count + 1
    print("Hit this breakpoint " + repr(bp_count) + " times!")
    DONE

In this case, since there is a reference to a global variable, 'bp_count', you will also need to make sure 'bp_count' exists and is initialized:

(lldb) script
>>> bp_count = 0
>>> quit()

Your Python code, however organized, can optionally return a value.  If the returned value is False, that tells LLDB not to stop at the breakpoint to
which the code is associated. Returning anything other than False, or even returning None, or even omitting a return statement entirely, will cause LLDB
to stop.

Final Note: A warning that no breakpoint command was generated when there are no syntax errors may indicate that a function was declared but never
called.
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.
