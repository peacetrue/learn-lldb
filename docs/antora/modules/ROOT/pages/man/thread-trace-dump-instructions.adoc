----
Dump the traced instructions for one thread. If no thread is specified, show the current thread.

Syntax: thread trace dump instructions <cmd-options>

Command Options Usage:
  thread trace dump instructions [-Cfrt] [-c <count>] [-i <index>] [-s <index>]

       -C ( --continue )
            Continue dumping instructions right where the previous invocation of this command was left, or from the beginning if this is the first
            invocation. The --skip argument is discarded and the other arguments are preserved from the previous invocation when possible.

       -c <count> ( --count <count> )
            The number of instructions to display starting at the most recent instruction, or the oldest if --forwards is provided.

       -f ( --forwards )
            If specified, the trace is traversed forwards chronologically starting at the oldest instruction. Otherwise, it starts at the most recent
            one and the traversal is backwards.

       -i <index> ( --id <index> )
            Custom starting instruction id from where to start traversing. This id can be provided in decimal or hexadecimal representation.

       -r ( --raw )
            Dump only instruction address without disassembly nor symbol information.

       -s <index> ( --skip <index> )
            How many instruction to skip from the starting position of the trace before starting the traversal.

       -t ( --tsc )
            For each instruction, print the corresponding timestamp counter if available.
