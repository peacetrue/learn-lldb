= frame-recognizer-add

----
Add a new frame recognizer.

Syntax: frame recognizer add <cmd-options>

Command Options Usage:
  frame recognizer add [-x] [-f <boolean>] [-n <name>] [-s <shlib-name>]
  frame recognizer add [-x] [-f <boolean>] [-n <name>] [-l <python-class>] [-s <shlib-name>]

       -f <boolean> ( --first-instruction-only <boolean> )
            If true, only apply this recognizer to frames whose PC currently points to the first instruction of the specified function. If false, the
            recognizer will always be applied, regardless of the current position within the specified function. The implementer should keep in mind
            that some features, e.g. accessing function argument values via $arg<N>, are not guaranteed to work reliably in this case, so extra care
            must be taken to make the recognizer operate correctly. Defaults to true.

       -l <python-class> ( --python-class <python-class> )
            Give the name of a Python class to use for this frame recognizer.

       -n <name> ( --function <name> )
            Name of the function that this recognizer applies to. Can be specified more than once except if -x|--regex is provided.

       -s <shlib-name> ( --shlib <shlib-name> )
            Name of the module or shared library that this recognizer applies to.

       -x ( --regex )
            Function name and module name are actually regular expressions.

Frame recognizers allow for retrieving information about special frames based on
ABI, arguments or other special properties of that frame, even without source
code or debug info. Currently, one use case is to extract function arguments
that would otherwise be unaccesible, or augment existing arguments.

Adding a custom frame recognizer is possible by implementing a Python class
and using the 'frame recognizer add' command. The Python class should have a
'get_recognized_arguments' method and it will receive an argument of type
lldb.SBFrame representing the current frame that we are trying to recognize.
The method should return a (possibly empty) list of lldb.SBValue objects that
represent the recognized arguments.

An example of a recognizer that retrieves the file descriptor values from libc
functions 'read', 'write' and 'close' follows:

  class LibcFdRecognizer(object):
    def get_recognized_arguments(self, frame):
      if frame.name in ["read", "write", "close"]:
        fd = frame.EvaluateExpression("$arg1").unsigned
        value = lldb.target.CreateValueFromExpression("fd", "(int)%d" % fd)
        return [value]
      return []

The file containing this implementation can be imported via 'command script
import' and then we can register this recognizer with 'frame recognizer add'.
It's important to restrict the recognizer to the libc library (which is
libsystem_kernel.dylib on macOS) to avoid matching functions with the same name
in other modules:

(lldb) command script import .../fd_recognizer.py
(lldb) frame recognizer add -l fd_recognizer.LibcFdRecognizer -n read -s libsystem_kernel.dylib

When the program is stopped at the beginning of the 'read' function in libc, we
can view the recognizer arguments in 'frame variable':

(lldb) b read
(lldb) r
Process 1234 stopped
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.3
    frame #0: 0x00007fff06013ca0 libsystem_kernel.dylib`read
(lldb) frame variable
(int) fd = 3
