= command-regex

----
Define a custom command in terms of existing commands by matching regular expressions.

Syntax: command regex <cmd-name> [s/<regex>/<subst>/ ...]

Command Options Usage:
  command regex [-h <none>] [-s <none>] [<substitution-pair>]

       -h <none> ( --help <none> )
            The help text to display for this command.

       -s <none> ( --syntax <none> )
            A syntax string showing the typical usage syntax.

This command allows the user to create powerful regular expression commands with substitutions. The regular expressions and substitutions are specified
using the regular expression substitution format of:

    s/<regex>/<subst>/

<regex> is a regular expression that can use parenthesis to capture regular expression input and substitute the captured matches in the output using %1
for the first match, %2 for the second, and so on.

The regular expressions can all be specified on the command line if more than one argument is provided. If just the command name is provided on the
command line, then the regular expressions and substitutions can be entered on separate lines, followed by an empty line to terminate the command
definition.

EXAMPLES

The following example will define a regular expression command named 'f' that will call 'finish' if there are no arguments, or 'frame select
<frame-idx>' if a number follows 'f':

    (lldb) command regex f s/^$/finish/ 's/([0-9]+)/frame select %1/'
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.
