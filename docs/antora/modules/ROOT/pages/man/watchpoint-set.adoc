Commands for setting a watchpoint.

Syntax: watchpoint set <subcommand> [<subcommand-options>]

The following subcommands are supported:

      expression -- Set a watchpoint on an address by supplying an expression. Use the '-w' option to specify the type of watchpoint and the '-s' option
                    to specify the byte size to watch for. If no '-w' option is specified, it defaults to write. If no '-s' option is specified, it
                    defaults to the target's pointer byte size. Note that there are limited hardware resources for watchpoints. If watchpoint setting
                    fails, consider disable/delete existing ones to free up resources.  Expects 'raw' input (see 'help raw-input'.)
      variable   -- Set a watchpoint on a variable. Use the '-w' option to specify the type of watchpoint and the '-s' option to specify the byte size
                    to watch for. If no '-w' option is specified, it defaults to write. If no '-s' option is specified, it defaults to the variable's
                    byte size. Note that there are limited hardware resources for watchpoints. If watchpoint setting fails, consider disable/delete
                    existing ones to free up resources.

For more help on any particular subcommand, type 'help <command> <subcommand>'.
