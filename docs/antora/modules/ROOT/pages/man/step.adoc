= step

----
Source level single step, stepping into calls.  Defaults to current thread unless specified.

Syntax: step <cmd-options> [<thread-id>]

Command Options Usage:
  step [-c <count>] [-e <linenum>] [-m <run-mode>] [-a <boolean>] [-t <function-name>] [-A <boolean>] [-r <regular-expression>] [<thread-id>]

       -A <boolean> ( --step-out-avoids-no-debug <boolean> )
            A boolean value, if true stepping out of functions will continue to step out till it hits a function with debug information.

       -a <boolean> ( --step-in-avoids-no-debug <boolean> )
            A boolean value that sets whether stepping into functions will step over functions with no debug information.

       -c <count> ( --count <count> )
            How many times to perform the stepping operation - currently only supported for step-inst and next-inst.

       -e <linenum> ( --end-linenumber <linenum> )
            The line at which to stop stepping - defaults to the next line and only supported for step-in and step-over.  You can also pass the string
            'block' to step to the end of the current block.  This is particularly use  in conjunction with --step-target to step through a complex
            calling sequence.

       -m <run-mode> ( --run-mode <run-mode> )
            Determine how to run other threads while stepping the current thread.
            Values: this-thread | all-threads | while-stepping

       -r <regular-expression> ( --step-over-regexp <regular-expression> )
            A regular expression that defines function names to not to stop at when stepping in.

       -t <function-name> ( --step-in-target <function-name> )
            The name of the directly called function step in should stop at when stepping into.
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.

'step' is an abbreviation for 'thread step-in'
