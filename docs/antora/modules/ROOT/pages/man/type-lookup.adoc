= type-lookup

----
Lookup types and declarations in the current target, following language-specific naming conventions.  Expects 'raw' input (see 'help raw-input'.)

Syntax: type lookup <type-specifier>

Command Options Usage:
  type lookup [-h] [-l <source-language>]

       -h ( --show-help )
            Display available help for types

       -l <source-language> ( --language <source-language> )
            Which language's types should the search scope be

For Swift, in addition to a simple type name (such as String, Int, NSObject, ..), one can also provide:
- a mangled type name (e.g. $sSiD)
- the name of a function, even if multiple overloads of it exist
- the name of an operator
- the name of a module available in the current target, which will print all types and declarations available in that module
     
     Important Note: Because this command takes 'raw' input, if you use any command options you must use ' -- ' between the end of the command options
     and the beginning of the raw input.
