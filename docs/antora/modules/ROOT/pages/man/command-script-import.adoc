----
Import a scripting module in LLDB.

Syntax: command script import <cmd-options> <filename> [<filename> [...]]

Command Options Usage:
  command script import [-crs] <filename> [<filename> [...]]

       -c ( --relative-to-command-file )
            Resolve non-absolute paths relative to the location of the current command file. This argument can only be used when the command is being
            sourced from a file.

       -r ( --allow-reload )
            Allow the script to be loaded even if it was already loaded before. This argument exists for backwards compatibility, but reloading is
            always allowed, whether you specify it or not.

       -s ( --silent )
            If true don't print any script output while importing.
     
     This command takes options and free-form arguments.  If your arguments resemble option specifiers (i.e., they start with a - or --), you must use '
     -- ' between the end of the command options and the beginning of the arguments.
